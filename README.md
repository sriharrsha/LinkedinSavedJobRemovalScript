# LinkedIn Saved Jobs Remover

**Problem Statement:** LinkedIn's Saved Jobs feature has a limit of 2000 job listings. Once this limit is reached, users cannot save new job listings without removing some of the old ones. This script is designed to help users automatically remove archived saved jobs, allowing them to save new listings without manual intervention. 

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Use this script at your own discretion. It automates actions on your LinkedIn profile, and while it's designed to be safe and only remove archived saved jobs, unforeseen circumstances might cause different behavior. Always back up your data, and understand the implications of automated scripts.

## Prerequisites

- Google Chrome Browser
- LinkedIn profile with archived saved jobs at: [https://www.linkedin.com/my-items/saved-jobs/?cardType=ARCHIVED](https://www.linkedin.com/my-items/saved-jobs/?cardType=ARCHIVED)

2. **Open Chrome Developer Console**: 

   - Right-click anywhere on the LinkedIn page.

3. **Run the Script**:
